For admission, candidates must possess a B.Sc. Eng. or equivalent degree with a minimum CGPA of 2.65 on a 4.00 scale, or its equivalent from any recognized University/Institution in the relevant field/branch. Additionally, applicants must have attained a CGPA of at least 3.50 on a 5.00 scale or its equivalent in both SSC and HSC levels, or a CGPA of 3.00 on a 4.00 scale or its equivalent in Diploma in Engineering or equivalent examinations. Successful applicants for the master's programs should hold a B.Sc. Eng. degree or equivalent in the relevant field from a recognized University/Institute with a strong academic background. Those demonstrating higher research aptitude are particularly encouraged to apply. KUET offers admission twice a year (January Term and July Term), with respective departments conducting interviews to select candidates.

Upon selection, candidates are required to complete the admission process by depositing the prescribed amount of money into the bank. The program accommodates both full-time and part-time students. Financial assistance may be available for full-time students who demonstrate exceptional merit. Part-time students must obtain consent from their employer to pursue postgraduate studies.

The courses in which a student has obtained ‘D’ or a higher grade will be counted as credits earned by him/her. Any course in which a student has obtained ‘F’ grade will not be counted towards his/her earned credits calculation. A student who obtains an ‘F’ grade in any core course in any Term, he/she will have to repeat the course. If a student obtains an ‘F’ in an optional course he/she may choose to repeat the course or take a substitute course, if available. F grades will not be counted for GPA calculation but will stay permanently on the grade sheet and transcript.

When a student will repeat a Backlog course in which he/she previously obtained ‘F’ grade, he/she will not be eligible to get a grade better than B+ (B plus) in such a course. A student obtaining D grade in a course, will be allowed to repeat the course for the purpose of grade improvement if CGPA of the student falls below 2.20 In such case he/she will be awarded the new grade thus he/she obtains or retains his/her previous grade if he/she fails. A student obtaining ‘C’ or a better grade in a course will not be allowed to repeat the course for the purpose of grade improvement if CGPA of the student falls below 2.20. Absence in Term final examination will result ‘F’ grade unless he/she has withdrawn from the Term.

Provisions will be made to assist students in completing their studies within the designated time frame of seven consecutive years for B.Sc. Eng./BURP and eight consecutive years for BArch. Students may seek approval from their Adviser and Head of the Department to take backlog courses under certain conditions. Backlog examinations will occur once per academic year. Registration for backlog courses can be done during the 6th to 8th weeks of classes for each even term, from the 1st Year 2nd Term to the 4th Year 1st Term for B.Sc. Eng./BURP, and from the 1st Year 2nd Term to the 5th Year 1st Term for BArch. These courses are undertaken as self-study, retaining previously obtained marks for class tests, attendance, performance, and assignments.

Furthermore, students can register for a maximum of 12 credits among the backlog courses from previous terms. The backlog examination, titled Backlog Examination with the corresponding year, will commence ten days after the last examination of regular even term courses within the department. The scheduling of backlog courses will follow the same interval as regular examinations. Dates and times for registration will be communicated in advance by the Registrar’s office, providing students with the necessary information to manage their academic progress effectively.

Certainly, here's the paragraph divided into multiple paragraphs for better readability:

Khulna University of Engineering & Technology has a background of historical significance. Although this institution has completed an era as university, its laying foundation began 49 years ago. This university was established in 1967 as ‘Khulna Engineering College’ under the University of Rajshahi. But during the period of liberation war the development activities of the Erstwhile Engineering College was suspended. After the Independence of Bangladesh in the year of 1971, the development works were started again in swing full. Overcoming all the constraints, the academic activities of the institute were virtually started from June 03, 1974 as per special direction of the Father of the Nation, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.

Despite some limitations, the college was affiliated as a faculty of Engineering under Rajshahi University. The academic and the administrative activities were controlled by the university authority and the Ministry of Education, respectively. The physical infrastructures were constructed by the public works department, while teacher recruitment was accomplished through Public Service Commission. Owing to multiple authorities, the co-ordination became complicated and hence the college authority faced many problems to run it smoothly. Even the admission of new students was stopped in one session due to the scarcity of teachers.

In these circumstances, through a collective effort organized by the students, teachers, officers, staff and professional bodies, the four Engineering Colleges of the country including Khulna Engineering College were converted into autonomous Institutes named as Bangladesh Institute of Technology (BIT) from July 01, 1986. In a new mood with a lot of hope and enthusiasm, BIT, Khulna started its journey to overcome the existing limitations to make this institute as the ‘Centre of Excellence’ in the south western region of Bangladesh. However, the nation’s demand to develop engineering education in real sense was not fulfilled.
Though BIT was converted to an autonomous Institution, the authority failed to take decisions regarding administrative, financial, and academic activities due to complicated systems. Hence all BITs started a massive campaign to materialize the demand for proper autonomy as the public university enjoys.

Finally, in order to fulfill the aspirations of the people and to suit the demand of the modern age, the government of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh decided to convert and upgrade these four BITs into universities of Engineering & Technology. Accordingly, BIT Khulna became Khulna University of Engineering & Technology, with the other BITs following suit, as per the act passed by the National Parliament effective from September 01, 2003.

As Khulna Engineering College, this institute started its academic journey in June 03, 1974, with 120 students and 9 teachers. There were only three departments: Civil Engineering, Electrical and Electronic Engineering, and Mechanical Engineering, with initially 40 students in each department. There was only one female student at the time of admission in the 1st batch. Later on, another female student was transferred here and the total number of students became 136. After two years, the intake of students was increased to 60 for each Department, and it continued for a long time.

At the beginning, there was only one hostel, presently named as Fazlul Haque Hall, and there was no canteen. Later on, a temporary canteen was established at the Boiler House of Mechanical Engineering Department. Within this time, the construction works of the administrative, library, and the residential buildings of the teachers, officers & staff were almost completed. There was no pavement road in the campus, not even any direct connective road from Khulna-Jessore Highway to the campus. The existing road was constructed first in 1978.

Though the academic activities were started, there were no laboratories, and so the practical classes of 1st year of Mechanical Engineering Department were held at BUET, and the practical classes of 2nd year of Mechanical Engineering Department at Rajshahi Engineering College. The practical classes of Civil Engineering Department and Electrical and Electronic Engineering Department were held at the campus. At the beginning of the academic session, there was no officer posted in Engineering College. There were only 10 third-class staff and 3 fourth-class staff. The construction works were done based on the previous plan. Four hostels were constructed for male students, but there was no hostel for female students. The female students used to reside on the first floor of the present primary school building. The shortage of teachers during this period made it difficult to fulfill the requirements of the students.

During the early years of its establishment, Khulna Engineering College (KEC) faced challenges due to a lack of experienced teachers, hindering the maintenance of educational standards. However, despite these initial constraints, a total of 715 students successfully obtained B. Sc. Engineering Degrees from KEC between 1974 and 1986. The passing students demonstrated excellence both domestically and internationally through their merit, quality, and wisdom.

In the leadership of KEC, notable figures such as Professor Dr. M. N. Azam (1969-1972), Dr. Samsuddin Ahmed (1972-1973), and Professor Haider Azam (1973-1974) served as Project Directors and the 1st Principal respectively. Following them, Professor Dr. Abul Kalam Azad (1974-1979 and 1980-1982) and Professor M. A. Hannan (1979-1980 and 1982-1986) assumed the role of Principals, contributing to the institute's growth and development.

After 17 years of its establishment as Khulna Engineering College, along with three other engineering colleges in the country, it was converted into Bangladesh Institute of Technology (BIT), Khulna through an ordinance. This transformation brought significant changes in the administrative, academic, and financial aspects, including the alteration of its management structure.

Under the new framework, BITs were governed by a Council, with the Hon’ble President of Bangladesh serving as the 'Visitor' and the Minister for Education acting as the 'Chairman' of the Council. Each BIT had a Board of Governors (BOG) as its highest authority, responsible for conducting official matters through meetings. The Director of each BIT, appointed by the Hon’ble President, served as the Executive Head of the institute.

Despite being granted autonomy in formation, BITs did not fully enjoy it due to the absence of necessary acts, rules, and regulations. However, they did have academic autonomy. Notably, in 1994, M. Sc. Engineering and Ph. D. courses were introduced in the Engineering departments, followed by the initiation of M. Phil. and Ph. D. degrees in the departments of basic science in 2000.


BIT, Khulna offered M. S. Eng., M. Phil. and Ph. D. Degree in the year of 2000, 2004 and 2005, respectively for the first time. The first new department named as Computer Science & Engineering (CSE) was started with 60 students in 1999. The government of Bangladesh took special consideration for the expansion and further development of BIT, Khulna and sanctioned Tk. 101 crore in the year of 2000 for the duration of 7 years. Number of students, teachers, officers and staff were increased to a great extent. Number of intake students in the Departments of CE, EEE and ME was increased to 120.

In 2001, two new departments namely Industrial Engineering and Management (IEM) and Electronics & Communication Engineering (ECE) were opened at under graduate level. In the year of 2006, 30 students got admitted in under graduate course of Industrial & Production Engineering under (IEM) Dept. In this period, the number of halls for accommodation of the students became five. The halls were named as Fazlul Haque Hall, Lalon Shah Hall, Khanjahan Ali Hall, Dr. M. A. Rashid Hall and Rokeya Hall. In addition to this, the government sanctioned grants for the construction of 2 new Halls.
The construction work of the new academic building was completed (1st phase) in 2005. The construction work of Water Treatment Plant was also completed in the year of 2001. Total 2563 students obtained B. Sc. Engineering degree during the period of BIT, out of which 913, 921 and 729 students were from the Departments of CE, EEE and ME respectively. During the period of BIT, Khulna, two Convocations were held in the year of 1999 and 2003. Prof. M. A. Hannan (1986-1997), Prof. G. M. Habibullah (1997-1998), Prof. Dr. M. A. Samad (1998-2002) and Prof. Dr. Md. Nawsher Ali Morol (2002-2003) were the Directors of BIT, Khulna.
In 2003, Bangladesh Institute of Technology (BIT), Khulna underwent conversion and upgrade to Khulna University of Engineering & Technology through an Act passed in the National Parliament of Bangladesh. Consequently, the council of BITs was abolished, and the University began to be guided by the University Grants Commission (UGC) of Bangladesh. Like other universities, it required the approval, cooperation, and coordination of the UGC, Ministry of Education, and Planning Commission in decision-making and development.

After the conversion into a University, the Director of BIT assumed the role of Vice-Chancellor according to the Act of the University until a new Vice-Chancellor was appointed. After 11 months, on July 29, 2004, Prof. Dr. Ehsanul Hoque of Bangladesh University of Engineering & Technology (BUET) was appointed as Vice-Chancellor and remained in the position until August 27, 2006. Following him, Professor Dr. Md. Nawsher Ali Morol from the Mechanical Engineering Department served as Vice-Chancellor until July 20, 2010. Dr. Muhammed Alamgir, a Professor in the Department of Civil Engineering, was then appointed as Vice-Chancellor on July 21, 2010. He continued for a second term, starting from August 3, 2014, until August 2, 2018.

After Dr. Alamgir, Dr. Quazi Sazzad Hossain, a Professor in the Department of Civil Engineering, was appointed as Vice-Chancellor on August 13, 2018. Upon upgradation to a University, existing rules and regulations related to academic, administration, financial, and development activities were revised accordingly. Furthermore, a new organogram was formulated and received final approval from the Ministry of Education in 2011. This organogram encompassed academic degree and non-degree programs, research, development, and structural plans up to 2018-2019.

The new University saw the establishment of new departments, institutes, and necessary infrastructures. Currently, there are three faculties, three Institutes, and eighteen departments. Plans include opening one faculty, one institute, and three additional departments by June 2019. The existing faculties are Civil Engineering, Electrical and Electronic Engineering, and Mechanical Engineering, with the establishment of a new Faculty of Science & Engineering underway.

In 2007, two Post Graduate Departments, Energy Technology (now Energy Science & Engineering) and Bio-Medical Engineering, commenced activities by admitting students at the postgraduate level. Subsequently, the Institute of Information and Communication Technology (IICT), the Institute of Disaster Management (IDM), and the Institute of Environment and Power Technology (IEPT) were opened in 2010, 2014, and 2016, respectively. Following the upgrade to KUET in 2003, four new undergraduate departments were initiated: Urban and Regional Planning (URP) and Leather Engineering (LE) in 2010, Textile Engineering (TE) in 2012, and Building Engineering and Construction Management (BECM) in 2014, each with an annual intake of 60 students.

Sure, here's the provided text divided into multiple paragraphs for better readability:

---

Moreover, in the 2014-15 session, the Bio-Medical Engineering department extended its academic activities at the undergraduate level, admitting 30 students every year. The Materials Science and Engineering (MSE) department at KUET began its journey in May 2016 under the Faculty of Electrical and Electronic Engineering. Currently, the department offers a Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) in engineering degree with an intake of 60 students per year. The Architecture department of KUET commenced its academic journey in February 2017 with an initial intake of 40 students. Additionally, two more new departments, Mechatronics Engineering and Chemical Engineering, were opened. Consequently, the total number of students in undergraduate courses increased to 1065 for admission in the first year, with further expansion planned to reach 1385. Presently, the total number of students stands at 5934, comprising 4834 undergraduate and 1100 postgraduate students.

The staffing numbers have also seen growth, with 320 teachers, 132 officers, and 292 staff currently in service. Plans are underway to increase these numbers by 2018-2019, aiming for a total of 7700 students, 618 teachers, 216 officers, and 728 staff. Research activities have expanded significantly during this period, with students at various levels obtaining their degrees, including Ph.D. students, M.Phil. students, M.Sc. Engineering students, and undergraduate students. KUET has held convocations three times, in 2006, 2012, and 2018, where degrees were awarded by the Honorable Chancellor of the University.

The establishment of new departments necessitates infrastructural development. Governmental agencies like the University Grants Commission (UGC), Ministry of Education, and Planning Commission are collaborating with university authorities to develop resources and infrastructure. Mega projects under the Ministry of Education are underway, alongside the Academic Innovation Fund (AIF) financed by the World Bank through HEQEP of UGC and Ministry of Education (MoE). These projects aim to enhance automation, academic, and research activities. Development activities for academic and research facilities are aligned with the nation's demands and necessities. The central library has been upgraded and relocated to a new academic building to provide more space and an attractive reading environment. Notably, the Central Library has recently been fully automated, a first among the public universities of Bangladesh.

A good-looking Main Gate Complex with modern architectural concept, the Great Liberation War Memorial Monument “Durbar Bangla”, nearly seven hundred seated Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Hall, the construction work of the extension up to 4th floor of the new Academic Building has also been completed while the construction work of the fifth floor is going on.

Moreover, the construction works of modern Medical Centre having more facilities, Guest House-cum-Club Building, High Voltage Lab, Leather Engineering Building, a new Block of Rokeya Hall up to the first floor with a Utility Bhaban, four-storied Residential Building for Senior Teachers and Officers, and the extension of Administrative Building up to the first floor have been completed recently.

Additionally, the construction works of Students Welfare Centre cum Central Cafeteria, Shaheed Minar, URP building, extension of Civil and Mechanical building, and the third floor of Planning & Engineering Building have been completed recently.

Furthermore, the university authority is also planning to renovate Science Building Gallery, Auditorium, Campus roads, and many other old buildings. The playground of the university has been prepared and extended further. An international standard cricket pitch has been constructed for the students. Janata Bank and Dutch Bangla Bank have opened their ATM booths respectively.

The construction work of the new office Building for Janata Bank has been completed adjacent to the post office building. It is already in the plan to construct a temple for the religious activities of Hindu Communities.

In course of time, Khulna University of Engineering and Technology (KUET) has already become one of the leading public universities of Bangladesh giving special emphasis in the Engineering and Technological Education and research. KUET is well known for offering very high quality educational, research, and developmental programs in the major disciplines of engineering as well as basic sciences.

Department of Mathematics started its journey from the very beginning of this educational institution as engineering college in 1974. As Mathematics is the fundamental and core subject for engineering education the department of Mathematics started its academic curriculum along with all engineering departments namely Civil, Electrical and Mechanical Engineering. The department was and is responsible to teach Mathematics to the all undergraduate students in the various departments. With the advancement of time, the Engineering College was transformed to autonomous institution namely BIT and stared to enhance in every aspect.

New departments were opened and students in older departments were increased. With the enhanced responsibilities, this department has expanded and have been performing the vested responsibilities. When it was felt that postgraduate education is to be introduced in this institute, the department also come forward with the proposal to open postgraduate program, namely M.Phil. and Ph.D. program in this department also. The then BIT authority accepted the proposal, with the understanding that no new posts will be allotted to run postgraduate program. Again a transformation took place and KUET was established and with the other facilities the department is running successfully. But still no new post has been created for the postgraduate program. Very recently authority had accepted the proposal to open M.Sc. program and students have been admitted in this program from July 2014 semester.
