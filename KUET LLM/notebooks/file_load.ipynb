Course Designation and Numbering System KUET\\n\\nEach course is designated by a two to four letter code (e.g. CE, EE, ME, Hum, Math, Ch, Ph, etc) identifying the course offering department followed by a fourdigit number with the following criteria: \\n\\n8.1 The first digit will correspond to the year in which the students normally take the course. \\n\\n8.2 The second digit will correspond the Term (1 for 1st Term, 2 for 2nd Term and 0/1/2 for both Terms in case of optional courses only) in which the course is normally taken by the students. \\n\\n8.3 The third and fourth digits will be reserved for departmental use, of which the last digit will be odd for theoretical and even for sessional/laboratory course. \\n\\n8.4 The course designation system is illustrated by the following example:\\n\\nCSE 2201                                               Course Title:                                                                                                                                                                                                 3rd and 4th digits are reserved for departmental use. Last digit designates a course (odd No. for theoretical and even No. for sessional/laboratory course). \\n\\nSecond digit signifies Term number (1 for 1st Term, 2 for 2nd Term and 0/1/2 for both Terms in case of optional courses only). \\n\\nFirst digit signifies year (Second year). \\n\\nDepartmental identification code (Computer Science and Engineering).\\n\\n\\n\\nN.B.: There will be one blank space after departmental identification code. \\n\\n8.5 Project/thesis courses for B.Sc. Eng/BURP shall be designated by the departmental identification code followed by 4000 (Example: CE 4000) applicable for both the Terms. For BArch the code shall be 5000.\\n\\n\\n\\n9. Classification of Courses in KUET\\n\\nThe courses included in undergraduate curricula are classified as follows: \\n\\n9.1 Core Courses In each department a number of courses will be identified as core courses which form the nucleus of the respective Bachelor’s degree program. A student has to complete all the designated core courses for his/her degree. \\n\\n9.2 Pre-requisite Courses Some of the core courses are identified as pre-requisite courses. A pre-requisite course is one which is required to be completed/appeared at the examination before some other course(s) can be taken. Any such course, on which one or more subsequent courses built up, may be offered in each of the two regular Terms (if possible). \\n\\n9.3 Optional Courses Apart from the core courses, a student will have to take a number of courses which he/she can choose from a specified group/number of courses to complete the credit requirements. \\n\\n9.4 Non Credit Courses Non credit course(s) may be offered to a student to improve his/her knowledge in some specific fields. The credits in these courses will not be counted for GPA and CGPA calculation but will be reflected in the transcript as satisfactory (S)/unsatisfactory (U). Non-credit course(s) may be offered under the following circumstances: If a student's Thesis/Project supervisor feels that the study/design is highly related to course(s) offered by any department for their students, he can recommend to the concerned Head of the Department for participation of the student(s) in the course(s). Such registration of course(s) will not affect the normal course registration of the student.\\n\\n 9.5 Backlog Courses The course(s) which a student registered in a Term but after Term final examination he/she obtained ‘F’ grade in that course(s) and also the withdrawal courses as defined by Article 23.1(ii). 9.6 Withdrawal Courses The courses which were withdrawn by a student due to some reasons as mentioned in Article 11.8. \\n\\n9.7 Incomplete Courses The unregistered course(s) and the course(s) that a student has registered but cancelled according to Article 11.3 will be defined as incomplete course(s).\\n\\n\\n\\n9.

Such registration of course(s) will not affect the normal course registration of the student. \\n\\n9.5 Backlog Courses KUET\\n\\nThe course(s) which a student registered in a Term but after Term final examination he/she obtained ‘F’ grade in that course(s) and also the withdrawal courses as defined by Article 23.1(ii). \\n\\n9.6 Withdrawal Courses \\n\\nThe courses which were withdrawn by a student due to some reasons as mentioned in Article 11.8. \\n\\n9.7 Incomplete Courses \\n\\nThe unregistered course(s) and the course(s) that a student has registered but cancelled according to Article 11.3 will be defined as incomplete course(s).\\n\\n\\n\\n10. Departmental Functional Bodies KUET\\n\\n10.1 Departmental Monitoring Committee Each degree-awarding department will form a Departmental Monitoring Committee with Head of the Department as Chairman and 4 (four) senior most teachers of the department as members. The Committee may propose any change and modifications time to time needed for upgrading/changing the Undergraduate Course Curriculum to ACUG. The Committee will also nominate Course Coordinator and Advisers for the student. \\n\\n10.2 Student Adviser An Adviser (normally not below the rank of Assistant Professor) will be nominated for one or more students for the entire period of study by the Departmental Monitoring Committee. He/She will advise each student on the courses to be taken in a Term. However, it is the student’s responsibility to keep contact with the Adviser who will review and eventually approve the student’s specific plan of study and monitor on subsequent progress of the student. For a student of second and subsequent Terms, the type of courses for which he/she can register will be decided on the basis of his/her academic performance during the previous Term. The Adviser will advise the students to register the courses during the next Term within the framework of the guidelines in respect of minimum/maximum credit hours limit. He/She may advise the student to change one or more courses among the offered courses based on student’s academic performance. \\n\\n10.3 Course Coordinator In each degree-awarding department, one of the Teachers (normally not below the rank of Assistant Professor) nominated by the Departmental Monitoring Committee, will act normally for 2 (two) Terms as Course Coordinator and Member Secretary to the ACUG. \\n\\n11. Course Registration for Regular/Incomplete/Withdrawal Course(s) KUET\\n\\n11.1 Pre-condition for Registration A student will be allowed to register courses, depending upon his/her performance. If a student fails in a pre-requisite course in any term, he can register for a course which builds on the pre-requisite course provided his attendance does not fall below 60%. A student having outstanding dues to the University or a Hall of Residence shall not be permitted to register. \\n\\n11.2 A regular student can register a maximum of 5 (five) theoretical courses in addition to sessional/project/thesis/ field work/seminar/sessional related courses in a Term those offered in that Term in any Year. No student will be allowed to register courses from different Terms in any Term (For example: In case of registration for 1st Year 1st Term, a student can register maximum five theoretical courses in addition to sessional courses/sessional related courses among the offered courses for 1st Year 1st Term only). No student can register any backlog course along with the regular courses in a Term. The total number of credit hours shall generally be between 15 to 24 credits in a Term. However, a student may be allowed to register less than 15 (fifteen) credits in a Term if\\n\\n i) the number of credits required for graduation is less than 15 (fifteen) in that Term and \\n\\nii) he/she cannot find appropriate courses for registration.\\n\\n11.3 If a student fails to attend 60% of the classes of any registered course in a Term whatever be the reasons, then the registration will be cancelled for that course and the course be treated as Incomplete course. \\n\\n11.4 Registration Procedure \\n\\nThe date and time for registration will be announced in advance by the Registrar’s office. Students will register his/her courses in a Term according to following guidelines: \\n\\ni) A student must pay Hall dues before the course registration of a Term. \\n\\nii) The student must pay the course registration fees as per rule. \\n\\niii) The student will finalize courses to be taken in consultation with his/her Adviser from the courses offered by the respective Department \\n\\niv) The student will complete the registration and respective Adviser and Head of the Department will confirm it. \\n\\nThe Registrar’s office will distribute course-wise list of registered students to the concerned department and Controller of examinations. \\n\\n11.5 Registration Deadline\\n\\n A student must register for the courses to be taken within first 8 (eight) working days of class of each Term.

The result of each individual class test shall be posted for information of the students preferably before the next class test is held.\\n\\n\\n\\n16. Earned Credits, Backlog and CGPA Improvement KUET\\n\\nThe courses in which a student has obtained ‘D’ or a higher grade will be counted as credits earned by him/her. Any course in which a student has obtained ‘F’ grade will not be counted towards his/her earned credits calculation. A student who obtains an ‘F’ grade in any core course in any Term, he/she will have to repeat the course. If a student obtains an ‘F’ in an optional course he/she may choose to repeat the course or take a substitute course, if available. F grades will not be counted for GPA calculation but will stay permanently on the grade sheet and transcript. When a student will repeat a Backlog course in which he/she previously obtained ‘F’ grade, he/she will not be eligible to get a grade better than B+ (B plus) in such a course. A student obtaining D grade in a course, will be allowed to repeat the course for the purpose of grade improvement if CGPA of the student falls below 2.20 In such case he/she will be awarded the new grade thus he/she obtains or retains his/her previous grade if he/she fails. A student obtaining ‘C’ or a better grade in a course will not be allowed to repeat the course for the purpose of grade improvement if CGPA of the student falls below 2.20. Absence in Term final examination will result ‘F’ grade unless he/she has withdrawn from the Term as per Article 11.8.\\n\\n\\n\\n17. Performance Evaluation KUET\\n\\nThe minimum CGPA requirement for obtaining a B. Sc. Eng./BURP/BArch degree is 2.20. The performance of a student will be evaluated in terms of two indices, viz. GPA and CGPA. Students will be considered to be making normal progress toward a degree if their CGPA for all courses passed is 2.20 or more. Students whose GPA will fall below 2.20 will have to appeal to the Head of the Department through his Adviser for the course registration so that the necessary remedial measures can be taken.\\n\\n\\n\\n18. Honors, Dean's List and University Gold Medal KUET\\n\\n18.1 Honors \\n\\nCandidates for Bachelor’s degree will be awarded the degree with Honors if their CGPA is 3.75 or better. \\n\\n18.2 Dean's List \\n\\nIn recognition of excellent performance, the names of students who maintains an average GPA of 3.75 or above in two regular Terms of an academic year may be published in the Dean's List in each Faculty and he/she will be given a certificate from respective Dean as recognition. Students who have received an 'F' grade in any course during any of the two consecutive regular Terms will not be considered for Dean's List in that year. \\n\\n18.3 University Gold Medal \\n\\nUniversity Gold Medal for outstanding graduates will be presented to the students who secure the 1st position in each Department and whose CGPA is above or equal to 3.75. The student must have completed his/her undergraduate course work within four consecutive academic years for B.Sc. Eng./BURP and five consecutive academic years for BArch with no 'F' grades and have a satisfactory attendance to his credit.\\n\\n\\n\\n19.

Probation and Suspension \\n\\nStudents who fail to maintain minimum GPA of 2.20 and could not complete the minimum credit requirements may be placed on academic probation. The status of academic probation is a reminder/warning to the student that satisfactory progress towards graduation is not being made. A student may be placed on academic probation when either of the following conditions exists:\\n\\ni) The GPA falls below    2.20, or\\n\\nii) The CGPA falls below 2.20\\n\\nStudents on probation are subjected to such restrictions with respect to courses and extracurricular activities as may be imposed by the respective Head of the Department. The minimum period of probation is one Term, but the usual period is one academic year. A student must improve himself during this period and will be required to pass the backlog courses. Any student who doesn't improve himself/herself during probation period may be suspended on receiving report from the Head of the Department.\\n\\nA student on academic probation who fails to maintain a GPA of at least 2.20 during two consecutive academic years may be suspended from the University. A student who has been suspended may apply for consideration to the ViceChancellor.\\n\\nPetitions for reinstatement must indicate clearly the reasons for the previous unsatisfactory academic record. It must describe the improved conditions that have been created to prevent the recurrence of such work. Each such petition will be considered individually on its own merits. After consideration of the petition and after consultation with the student Adviser and the respective Head of the Department, the Vice-Chancellor in some cases may reinstate the student if this is the first suspension. However, a second suspension case will be placed before the Academic Council for final decision.\\n\\n\\n\\n21. Measures to complete Backlog courses \\n\\nThe following provisions will be made as far as possible to help the students to enable them to complete their studies within the maximum period of seven consecutive years (fourteen Terms) for B.Sc. Eng./BURP and Eight consecutive years (Sixteen terms) for BArch. In this context, the students may be allowed to take backlog courses subject to the approval of his/her Adviser and Head of the Department based on the following rules:\\n\\ni) The Backlog examination will be held once in an academic year. \\n\\nii) A student can register backlog courses normally during 6th to 8th weeks of classes of each even Term from 1st Year 2nd Term to 4th year 1st term for B.Sc. Eng./BURP and 1st year 2nd term to 5th Year 1st Term for BArch as self-study (i.e., retaining the already obtained marks of class tests and class attendance with class performance & assignments). \\n\\niii) A student can register maximum 12 (twelve) credits among the backlog courses of previous all Terms and the name of backlog examination is Backlog Examination with the year of examination same as regular examination.\\n\\niv) The backlog examination will be started after 10 (ten) days from the last examination of the regular even Term courses of the concerned department and the interval between the backlog courses will be same as regular examination. \\n\\nv) The date and time for registration will be announced in advance by the Registrar’s office.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n22. Special Backlog Examination \\n\\nThe Special Backlog Examination on only backlog courses may be conducted for the students who have participated in their 4-year (up to 4th year 2nd Term) for B.Sc. Eng./ BURP and five-year (up to 5th year 2nd term) for BArch degree course and have a shortage of maximum 12 (twelve) credits to obtain Bachelor degree. The special backlog examination will be arranged in a convenient time by the Head of the Department after 30 (thirty) days of publication of results of the 4th Year 2nd Term for B. Sc.

Although this institution has completed an era as university, its laying foundation began 49 years ago. This university was established in 1967 as ‘Khulna Engineering College’ under the University of Rajshahi. But during the period of liberation war the development activities of the Erstwhile Engineering College was suspended. After the Independence of Bangladesh in the year of 1971, the development works were started again in swing full. Overcoming all the constraints, the academic activities of the institute were virtually started from June 03, 1974 as per special direction of the Father of the Nation, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. Despite some limitations, the college was affiliated as a faculty of Engineering under Rajshahi University. The academic and the administrative activities were controlled by the university authority and the Ministry of Education, respectively. The physical infrastructures were constructed by the public works department, while teacher recruitment was accomplished through Public Service Commission. Owing to multiple authorities, the co-ordination became complicated and hence the college authority faced many problems to run it smoothly. Even the admission of new students was stopped in one session due to the scarcity of teachers. In these circumstances, through a collective effort organized by the students, teachers, officers, staff and professional bodies, the four Engineering Colleges of the country including Khulna Engineering College were converted into autonomous Institutes named as Bangladesh Institute of Technology (BIT) from July 01, 1986.In a new mood with a lot of hope and enthusiasm, BIT, Khulna started its journey to overcome the existing limitations to make this institute as the ‘Centre of Excellence’ in the south western region of Bangladesh. However, the nation’s demand to develop engineering education in real sense was not fulfilled. Though BIT was converted to an autonomous Institution, the authority failed to take decisions regarding administrative, financial and academic activities due to complicated systems. Hence all BITs started a massive campaign to materialize the demand for proper autonomy as the public university enjoys. However, finally in order to fulfil the aspirations of the people and to suit to the demand of the Modern age, the government of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh decided to convert and upgrade these four BITs into universities of Engineering & Technology. Accordingly BIT, Khulna became Khulna University of Engineering & Technology with the other BITs as per act passed by the National Parliament effective from September 01, 2003.As Khulna Engineering College, this institute started its academic journey in June 03, 1974 with 120 students and 9 teachers. There were only three departments: Civil Engineering, Electrical and Electronic Engineering and Mechanical Engineering with initially 40 students in each department. There was only one female student at the time of admission in the 1st batch. Later on, another female student was transferred here and the total number of students became 136. After two years, the intake of students was increased to 60 for each Department and it continued for a long time. At the beginning, there was only one hostel, presently named as Fazlul Haque Hall and there was no canteen.Later on, a temporary canteen was established at the Boiler House of Mechanical Engineering Department. Within this time, the construction works of the administrative, library and the residential buildings of the teachers, officers & staff were almost completed. There was no pavement road in the campus, not even any direct connective road from Khulna-Jessore Highway to the campus. The existing road was constructed first in 1978. Though the academic activities were started, there were no laboratories and so the practical classes of 1st year of Mechanical Engineering Department were used to be held at BUET and the practical classes of 2nd year of Mechanical Engineering Department at Rajshahi Engineering College. The practical classes of Civil Engineering Department and Electrical and Electronic Engineering Department were used to be held at the campus. At the beginning of academic session there was no officer posted in Engineering College. There were only 10 third Class staff and 3 fourth Class staff. The construction works were done as based on the previous plan. Four hostels were constructed for the male students, but there was no hostel for female students. The female students used to reside at the first floor of the present primary school building. The shortage of teachers during this period made it difficult to fulfill the requirements of the students. Since there were no experienced teachers then, the authority could not maintain the standard of education. Finally, total 715 students (1974-1986) obtained the B. Sc. Engineering Degree from Khulna Engineering College. Despite all the constraints at the first period of this institute, the passing students proved their excellence both at home and abroad by dint of their merit, quality and wisdom.During the regime of KEC, Professor Dr. M. N. Azam (1969-1972) and Dr. Samsuddin Ahmed (1972-1973) were the Project Directors and Professor Haider Azam (1973-1974) was the 1st Principal. After him, Professor Dr. Abul Kalam Azad (1974-1979 and (1980-1982) and Professor M. A. Hannan (1979-1980 and 1982-1986) were the Principals of Khulna Engineering College.After 17 years of BIT, Khulna, with the other three engineering colleges of the country, Khulna Engineering College was converted into Bangladesh Institute of Technology (BIT), Khulna through an ordinance. After the conversion, its administrative, academic and financial power as well as management changed altogether. Hon’ble President of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh was the ‘Visitor’ of all BITs’. An office named as Council of BITs’ was also established in Dhaka and the Minister for Education was the ‘Chairman’ of the Council as an Ex-Officio. There was a Vice-Chairman of the Council of BITs’ as the executive Head of the Council. Board of Governors (BOG) was the highest authority of each BIT and the BOG conducted all the official works as required through its meeting. In each BIT there was a Director as the Executive Head of the institute, appointed by the Hon’ble President.The Chairman of BOG for each BIT was nominated by the Ministry of Education and he chaired all the authorities such as BOG, Selection Committee, etc. except the Academic Council. The Director of BIT was the Chairman of Academic Council. Despite the declaration of autonomy in the formation, BITs did not enjoy it due to the absence of required act, rules and regulations. It only enjoyed the academic autonomy. In the Engineering departments, M. Sc. Engineering and Ph. D. course were started in 1994 while M. Phil. and Ph. D. degrees were started in the departments of basic science in 2000. However, BIT, Khulna offered M. S. Eng., M. Phil. and Ph. D. Degree in the year of 2000, 2004 and 2005, respectively for the first time. The first new department named as Computer Science & Engineering (CSE) was started with 60 students in 1999 with 60 students. The government of Bangladesh took special consideration for the expansion and further development of BIT, Khulna and sanctioned Tk. 101 crore in the year of 2000 for the duration of 7 years. Number of students, teachers, officers and staff were increased to a great extent. Number of intake students in the Departments of CE, EEE and ME was increased to 120. In 2001, two new departments namely Industrial Engineering and Management (IEM) and Electronics & Communication Engineering (ECE) were opened at under graduate level. In the year of 2006, 30 students got admitted in under graduate course of Industrial & Production Engineering under (IEM) Dept. In this period, the number of halls for accommodation of the students became five. The halls were named as Fazlul Haque Hall, Lalon Shah Hall, Khanjahan Ali Hall, Dr. M. A. Rashid Hall and Rokeya Hall. In addition to this, the government sanctioned grants for the construction of 2 new Halls. The construction work of the new academic building was completed (1st phase) in 2005. The construction work of Water Treatment Plant was also completed in the year of 2001.Total 2563 students obtained B. Sc. Engineering degree during the period of BIT, out of which 913, 921 and 729 students were from the Departments of CE, EEE and ME respectively. During the period of BIT, Khulna, two Convocations were held in the year of 1999 and 2003. Prof. M. A. Hannan (1986-1997), Prof. G. M. Habibullah (1997-1998), Prof. Dr. M. A. Samad (1998-2002) and Prof. Dr. Md. Nawsher Ali Morol (2002-2003) were the Directors of BIT, Khulna.In 2003 Bangladesh Institute of Technology (BIT), Khulna was converted and upgraded to Khulna University of Engineering & Technology through an Act passed in the National parliament of Bangladesh. Consequently, the council of BITs was abolished and the University started to be guided by University Grants Commission (UGC) of Bangladesh. Like other universities, it requires the approval, co-operation and co-ordination of the UGC, Ministry of Education and Planning Commission in decision making and developement. After the conversion into University, the Director of the BIT started to act as the Vice-Chancellor according to the Act of the university until and unless the new Vice-Chancellor was being appointed. At last after 11 months, on July 29, 2004, Prof. Dr. Ehsanul Hoque of Bangladesh University of Engineering & Technology (BUET) was given the charge of Vice-Chancellor and remained in the position till August 27, 2006. After him, Professor Dr. Md. Nawsher Ali Morol, Professor, Mechanical Engineering Department became Vice-Chancellor and continued till July 20, 2010. Next to him, Dr. Muhammed Alamgir, Professor, Department of Civil Engineering was appointed as the Vice-Chancellor on 21 July 2010. After completing his first term successfully, Professor Alamgir has been continuing for the second term as the Vice-Chancellor since 3 August 2014 and completed his second term on 02 August 2018. After him, Dr. Quazi Sazzad Hossain, Professor, Department of Civil Engineering was appointed as the Vice-Chancellor on 13 August 2018. After upgradation as University, the existing rules and regulations related to academic, administration, financial and development activities were revised accordingly. Moreover, a new organogram was made for this University and it got final approval by the Minipstry of Education in the year of 2011. This organogram considers the academic degree and non-degree programmes, research, development, structural plan up to 2018-2019.In the new University, new departments, Institute, and necessary infrastructures are being started and constructed. At present, there are three faculties, three Institutes and eighteen Departments. In future, one faculty, one institute and three more departments will be opened by June 2019 as planned.The existing Faculties of this university are Faculty of Civil Engineering, Faculty of Electrical and Electronic Engineering and Faculty of Mechanical Engineering. Establishment of a new Faculty named as Faculty of Science & Engineering is now under process. In the year of 2007, two Post Graduate Departments of Energy Technology (ET) (now renamed as Energy Science & Engineering) and Bio-Medical Engineering (BME) started their activities by getting students admitted in Post Graduate levels. The Institute of Information and Communication Technology (IICT), The Institute of Disaster Management (IDM) and The Institute of Environment and Power Technology (IEPT) were opened in 2010, 2014 and 2016, respectively. After this institute upgraded into KUET in the year of 2003, four new undergraduate departments were started; these are Urban and Regional Planning (URP) and Leather Engineering (LE) in 2010, Textile Engineering (TE) in 2012 and Building Engineering and Construction Management (BECM) in 2014 with the intake of 60 students in each department in every year. Moreover, in 2014-15 session, Bio-Medical Engineering department has extended its academic activities in undergraduate level with the intake of 30 students in every year. The Materials Science and Engineering (MSE) department at KUET started its journey in May, 2016 under the faculty of Electrical and Electronic Engineering. The department currently offers Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) in engineering degree and has an intake of 60 students per year. The Architecture department of KUET is very new and started its academic journey in February 2017 with 40 students. Two more new departments, namely Mechatronics Engineering and Chemical Engineering are also opened. The total number of students at undergraduate course has been raised to 1065 for admission in the first year and this will be further increased to 1385. At present the total number of students is 5934 in which the number of students in undergraduate and postgraduate course are 4834 and 1100, respectively. Presently, 320 Teachers, 132 Officers, 292 staff are in service, which is planned to be increased by 2018-2019 to 7700 students, 618 teachers, 216 officers and 728 staff. Research activities have also been increased more than ever before. During this period Ph. D. Students, M. Phil. students, M. Sc. Engineering students including under graduate students have obtained their degrees. In KUET, convocation was held three times in 2006, 2012 and 2018 to award degree by the Hon’ble Chancellor of this University.The opening of new departments demands the infrastructural developments as well. The governmental agencies like University Grants Commission (UGC), Ministry of Education, and Planning Commission are working together with university authorities for necessary development of resources and infrastructure. Presently, a mega projects under the Ministry of Education is going on. Besides, the Academic Innovation Fund (AIF) financed by World Bank has been awarded for this university through HEQEP of UGC and Ministry of Education (MoE). These projects mainly contributed to the development of university by widening automation and enhancing the academic and research activities.The ongoing development activities for the infrastructure of academic and research facilities are being programed with the demand and necessity of the nation. In the meantime, the central library has been upgraded and shifted to the new academic building to provide more space and attractive reading environment. Central Library has recently been fully automated for the first time among the Public Universities of Bangladesh.A good-looking Main Gate Complex with modern architectural concept, the Great Liberation war Memorial Monument “Durbar Bangla”, nearly seven hundred seated Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Hall, the construction work of the extension up to 4th floor of the new Academic Building has also been completed while the construction work of fifth floor is going on. Moreover, the construction works of modern Medical Centre having more facilities, Guest House-cum-Club Building, High Voltage Lab, Leather Engineering Building, a new Block of Rokeya Hall up to first floor with a Utility Bhaban, four-storied Residential Building for Senior Teachers and Officers and the extension of Administrative Building up to first floor have been completed recently.Moreover, the construction works of Students Welfare Centre cum Central Cafeteria, Shaheed Minar, URP building, extension of Civil and Mechanical building and third floor of Planning & Engineering Building have been completed recently. The university authority is also planning to renovate Science Building Gallery, Auditorium, Campus roads and many other old buildings. The playground of the university has been prepared and extended further. An international standard cricket pitch has been constructed for the students. Janata Bank and Dutch Bangla Bank have opened their ATM booths respectively. The construction work of new office Building for Janata Bank has been completed adjacent to the post office building. It is already in the plan to construct a temple for the religious activities of Hindu Communities.In course of time, Khulna University of Engineering and Technology already has become one of the leading public universities of Bangladesh giving special emphasis in the Engineering and Technological Education and research. KUET is well known for offering very high quality educational, research and developmental programs in the major disciplines of engineering as well as basic sciences. It has a sober objective to achieve excellence in quality education, research and progression to address the present needs of the country as well as the South-Western region to make it as the \"Centre of Excellence\".\\n\\n The campus is located at Fulbarigate, about 13 km north from the Khulna City near the Khulna-Dhaka highway. Govt. B. L. College is located 4 km away from this campus to the southern side of it. Teacher\\'s Training College, Technical Training Center etc. are located at the western side and the Jahanabad Cantonment is located at the northern side of KUET campus. The Khulna-Dhaka highway is passing through the eastern side of the campus.The neighboring landmarks to KUET mentioned in the given context are Teacher\\'s Training College, Technical Training Center, and Jahanabad Cantonment,Govt Labratory High School. However, KUET is located on Fulbarigate, about 13 km north from the Khulna City near the Khulna-Dhaka highway. No specific landmarks have been mentioned in relation to its proximity to KUET.\\n\\nThe admission process in KUET is highly competitive. Each year it opens about 1065 seats for undergraduate programs. About 10,000 applicants are invited to appear on an admission test. This preliminary filtration is done based on H.S.C. grade points in physics, chemistry, mathematics and English. The admission test is standardized to evaluate student ability to understand concepts of physics, chemistry, mathematics, and English language. Admission is offered to successful applicants on a merit basis, based on their scores in the admission test.\\n\\nAdmission is open to mainly to Bangladeshi nationals. There are 5 reserved seats for \"small ethnic group\" students who have to undergo the same admission process. A few seats are also open to international students. The international admission process is separate from local admissions\\n\\n(The syllabus for the KUET admission test does not appear to be provided in the context provided.

As Mathematics is the fundamental and core subject for engineering education the department of Mathematics started its academic curriculum along with all engineering departments namely Civil, Electrical and Mechanical Engineering. The department was and is responsible to teach Mathematics to the all undergraduate students in the various departments. With the advancement of time, the Engineering College was transformed to autonomous institution namely BIT and stared to enhance in every aspect.\\n\\n\\n\\nNew departments were opened and students in older departments were increased. With the enhanced responsibilities, this department has expanded and have been performing the vested responsibilities. When it was felt that postgraduate education is to be introduced in this institute, the department also come forward with the proposal to open postgraduate program, namely M.Phil. and Ph.D. program in this department also. The then BIT authority accepted the proposal, with the understanding that no new posts will be allotted to run postgraduate program. Again a transformation took place and KUET was established and with the other facilities the department is running successfully. But still no new post has been created for the postgraduate program. Very recently authority had accepted the proposal to open M.Sc. program and students have been admitted in this program from July 2014 semester.\\n\\n  The faculty of Mechanical Engineering is one of the leading faculties at Khulna University of Engineering & Technology (KUET). Keeping in mind, the vision and mission of the university, the faculty offers high-quality undergraduate and postgraduate programs in different fields of engineering and technology. At present, there are seven academic departments. These are:\\n\\n1.Department of Mechanical Engineering\\n\\n2.Department of Industrial Engineering and Management\\n\\n3.Department of Energy Science and Engineering\\n\\n4.Department of Leather Engineering\\n\\n5.Department of Textile Engineering\\n\\n6.Department of Chemical Engineering\\n\\n7.Department of Mechatronics Engineering  \\n\\n  Khulna University of Engineering & Technology (KUET) is situated at Fulbarigate, the North-West part of the Khulna City, which is the third largest south-western divisional city in Bangladesh.\\n\\nThe Institute campus is about 15 (fifteen) kilometers away from the zero point of Khulna City, which is well-connected to the major city centers by open and wide roads. It is located at about 12 (twelve) kilometers away from the Inter-District Bus Terminal and approximately 14 (fourteen) kilometers from the Khulna Railway Station.\\n\\nThe Institute campus covers an area of 100 acres. It is divided into four functional zones: (i) Residential zone for the students, (ii) Residential zone for the faculties and staffs, (iii) Academic zone for the academic buildings & workshops, and (iv) Cultural-cum-social and recreational zone for the students.\\n\\nBeing square in-shape, the third zone has been located at mid-way between the two residential zones in order to make a comfortable walking distance.\\n\\nThe main academic building accommodates the different teaching and research facilities. However, each department is a separate entity with a courtyard around and all the departments constitute an integrated complex. Heavy Engineering Laboratories are positioned on the ground floor or other separate workshops. While light Laboratories, classrooms and project rooms are located on the upper floors. Separate offices have been provided to every member of the teaching staffs next to his/her laboratory. Large lecture theatres with the modern accessories and equipments for sound and projection are located in the courtyards between departments for common use. The campus also offers facilities like Teachers and Staff Clubs, Medical Center, Departmental Store, Bank with ATM Booth, Post Office and Playground etc. The Centre of coordinating the Students Welfare Activities provides all sorts of extra-curricular facilities to the students for their mental and physical development.\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nEstablished\\n\\n:\\n\\n01-01-1974\\n\\nHead\\n\\n:\\n\\nProf. Dr. Md.

The Architecture department of KUET is very new and started its academic journey in February 2017 with 40 students. Two more new departments, namely Mechatronics Engineering and Chemical Engineering are also opened. The total number of students at undergraduate course has been raised to 1065 for admission in the first year and this will be further increased to 1385. At present the total number of students is 5934 in which the number of students in undergraduate and postgraduate course are 4834 and 1100, respectively. Presently, 320 Teachers, 132 Officers, 292 staff are in service, which is planned to be increased by 2018-2019 to 7700 students, 618 teachers, 216 officers and 728 staff. Research activities have also been increased more than ever before. During this period Ph. D. Students, M. Phil. students, M. Sc. Engineering students including under graduate students have obtained their degrees. In KUET, convocation was held three times in 2006, 2012 and 2018 to award degree by the Hon’ble Chancellor of this University.\\n\\nThe opening of new departments demands the infrastructural developments as well. The governmental agencies like University Grants Commission (UGC), Ministry of Education, and Planning Commission are working together with university authorities for necessary development of resources and infrastructure. Presently, a mega projects under the Ministry of Education is going on. Besides, the Academic Innovation Fund (AIF) financed by World Bank has been awarded for this university through HEQEP of UGC and Ministry of Education (MoE). These projects mainly contributed to the development of university by widening automation and enhancing the academic and research activities.\\n\\nThe ongoing development activities for the infrastructure of academic and research facilities are being programed with the demand and necessity of the nation. In the meantime, the central library has been upgraded and shifted to the new academic building to provide more space and attractive reading environment. Central Library has recently been fully automated for the first time among the Public Universities of Bangladesh.\\n\\nA good-looking Main Gate Complex with modern architectural concept, the Great Liberation war Memorial Monument “Durbar Bangla”, nearly seven hundred seated Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Hall, the construction work of the extension up to 4th floor of the new Academic Building has also been completed while the construction work of fifth floor is going on. Moreover, the construction works of modern Medical Centre having more facilities, Guest House-cum-Club Building, High Voltage Lab, Leather Engineering Building, a new Block of Rokeya Hall up to first floor with a Utility Bhaban, four-storied Residential Building for Senior Teachers and Officers and the extension of Administrative Building up to first floor have been completed recently.\\n\\nMoreover, the construction works of Students Welfare Centre cum Central Cafeteria, Shaheed Minar, URP building, extension of Civil and Mechanical building and third floor of Planning & Engineering Building have been completed recently. The university authority is also planning to renovate Science Building Gallery, Auditorium, Campus roads and many other old buildings.

There were only three departments: Civil Engineering, Electrical and Electronic Engineering and Mechanical Engineering with initially 40 students in each department. There was only one female student at the time of admission in the 1st batch. Later on, another female student was transferred here and the total number of students became 136. After two years, the intake of students was increased to 60 for each Department and it continued for a long time. At the beginning, there was only one hostel, presently named as Fazlul Haque Hall and there was no canteen.\\n\\n Notable alumni[edit]\\n\\nQuazi Sazzad Hossain, former Vice-Chancellor of Khulna University of Engineering & Technology\\n\\n The campus of this university stands at North-West corner of Khulna City Corporation, about 12 Km from the city center, in the midst of an impressive natural beauty having vast greenery spreading over an area of 101 acres land.
