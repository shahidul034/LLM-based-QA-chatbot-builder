However, during the liberation war, development activities were suspended until they resumed after the independence of Bangladesh in 1971. The academic activities officially started on June 3, 1974, under the special direction of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. Despite facing challenges, the college continued its journey and eventually transformed into an autonomous institute named Bangladesh Institute of Technology (BIT) on July 1, 1986, along with three other engineering colleges in the country.\n"
