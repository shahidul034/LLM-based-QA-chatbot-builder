||//About KUET// 
Khulna University of Engineering & Technology (KUET) is one of the leading public universities of Bangladesh giving special emphasis in the Engineering and Technological Education and research. KUET is well known for offering very high quality educational, research and developmental programs in the major disciplines of engineering as well as basic sciences. It has a sober objective to achieve excellence in quality education, research and progression to address the present needs of the country as well as the South-Western region to make it as the "Center of Excellence".
||//History// Khulna University of Engineering & Technology (KUET), Bangladesh established in 1967 as Khulna Engineering College, starts its long cherished journey in 3 June, 1974 after receiving special direction from the Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. Later to ensure the better academic and research capabilities and environment, it is converted to an autonomous institute called Bangladesh Institute of Technology (BIT), Khulna in July 1986. To meet the demands of the days in the academic and research arena, the institute was upgraded and renamed as Khulna University of Engineering & Technology (KUET) in September 2003.[[History]]
||KUET offers engineering education in both undergraduate and post-graduate levels, and also offers degree and conducts research in basic sciences at post-graduate level. At present, around 5240 students are studying in KUET in 20 Academic Department under 3 Faculty. From the academic session (2018-2019), total 1065 top graded students of the country are enrolled yearly in undergraduate level in 16 departments through very competitive, transparent and standard admission test. Besides, quality level graduate study and research in M.Sc, M.Sc Engg, M.Phil and Ph.D. Programs are running in its nourished environment. Students from foreign counties are also studying in this prestigious institute. Around 356 eminent, scholarly and diverse faculties are engaged in teaching at this university in various disciplines.
||The campus of this university stands at North-West corner of Khulna City Corporation, about 12 Km from the city center, in the midst of an impressive natural beauty having vast greenery spreading over an area of 101 acres land. <br> 
||In every year, approximately seven hundred students graduate from this university at different branches of engineering and technology.[[About KUET]]

CCC was established in 1988 under the supervision of the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering. At the time of the inauguration, it had only six IBM desktop computers which were donated by BEXIMCO. In 2006, it was turned into an independent section to provide superior service in a renovated standalone building. In 2016, a newly created ICT cell was attached with CCC to enhance the development of integrated ICT support to automate different services of the university. Currently, this focal point of the university is supervised by a Chairman. Central Computer Center manages a High Definition Visual Computing and Multimedia Laboratory with 30 Windows-based high-definition computers.
